# COMP0034 Week 7 Coding activities

## Set-up

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked repository to create a project in your IDE
3. Create and activate a virtual environment in the project folder e.g.

    - MacOS: `python3 -m venv .venv` then `source .venv/bin/activate`
    - Windows: `py -m venv .venv` then `.venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Check `pip` is the latest versions: `pip install --upgrade pip`
5. Install the requirements. You may wish to edit [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) first to remove the packages for
   Flask or Dash if you only want to complete the activities for one type of app.

    - e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Install the paralympics app code e.g. `pip install -e .`

## Activity instructions

There are two versions of the activities. You can complete both, or just the version for the framework you intend
to use for coursework 2.

1. [Dash activities](activities/1-dash.md)
2. [Flask activities](activities/1-flask.md)
