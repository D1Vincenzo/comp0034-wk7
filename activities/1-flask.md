# Flask version of the activities

## Check the Flask app runs

Check that the app runs before starting any of the activities.

1. `flask --app paralympics_flask run --debug`

   You may need to change the port number if you already have something running on the default port 5000
   e.g. `flask --app paralympics_flask run --debug --port=5050`.
2. Go to the URL that is shown in the terminal. By default, this is http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. Stop the app using `CTRL+C`
