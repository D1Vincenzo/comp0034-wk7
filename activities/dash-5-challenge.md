# Challenge

This is optional for those that want to try and challenge themselves. 

There are no prepared solutions for these. If you solve them, share your code on Moodle Q&A for others to see.

1. Add a new chart
   - Add a new Row() with one or more columns to the layout.
   - Use the event_data in the `figures.py`
   - Create a new Plotly Expres chart .e.g. [bubble chart](https://plotly.com/python/bubble-charts/) or choose
     another [chart type](https://plotly.com/python/basic-charts/)
   - Add the chart to a dcc.Graph() element in one of the columns you created.
2. Display stats as a table rather than a card

   Rather than using a card to display the statistics, create a [table](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/docs/components/table/) instead (or as well). Add
   different event attributes to what was used in the Card example.
