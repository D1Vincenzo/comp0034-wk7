## Check the Dash app runs

1. `python paralympics_dash/paralympics_dash.py`

   You may need to change the port number if you already have something running on the default port 8050
   e.g. `flask --app paralympics_flask run --debug --port=5050`.

2. Go to the URL that is shown in the terminal. By default, this is <http://127.0.0.1:8050>.
3. Stop the app using `CTRL+C`
